        Sugar Beam is a group of amateur laser-burning enthusiasts who come together to share tips, projects, knowledge, and support in this exciting and developing hobby.
        We love to see creativity come to life through burns on wood, paper, leather, or even etching on metal. The possibilities are endless. If you can imagine it, design it, then you can burn it. 
        We’re working establishing a community forum here on the site, but in the meantime, we invite you to check out our scheduled classes and zoom meetings found on the “events” page.

        -	Can engrave on plywood, cardboard, paper, cotton, leather, non-woven fabrics, some plastics, powder-coated and plated metals. 
        -	You can also etch on certain materials, such as: leather stainless steel and aluminum (best outcome when they are coasted)
        -	Can cut hardwoods with multiple passes and depending on thickness.
        -	Best for crafts, wood engraving, ornaments, images, logos, 
        -	Perfect for a home workshop or small design project.
        -	Different brands: Comgrow Z1, xTool D1 Pro, Atomstack X7 Pro, Ortur LM2 Pro S2, Jinsoku LC-40

        -	Powerful, easy to assemble, and comes in a variety of sizes and price points with different space requirements.
        -	Often used in commercial settings 
        -	Will cost more than the entry-level diode models. 
        -	They are much more powerful and still can cut a wide range of materials.
        -	Wood, cardboard and paper, fabric and textiles, acrylic, leather, bamboo, rubber, anodized metal, glass, cement, stone, stainless steel 
        -	Will do 2D and 3D crafting and design projects.

        -	
        3.	Fiber Laser
        -	More ideal for industrial cutting
        -	Perfect for cutting, engraving, etching metals 
        -	Much more expensive than entry-level CO2 or diode models
        -	Low maintenance and have very long commercia lifespan
        -	Materials : gold, aluminum, steel, titanium, brass, copper, siver

      <h3>Events | FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Come Join us for a free online class in laser burning! 
        Location: Zoom 
        Time: 10 to 11 AM  
        Join us for a Q&A session followed by a step by step walk through for a simple beginner’s laser project. You do not need to own a printer to attend. We will specifically be covering LightBurn software this month. 

        FAQ
        1.	How to prevent Burning when Laser Cutting 
        -	Air assist is generally just compressed air that is directed to the point at which the laser beam makes contact with the material, and can help prevent or reduce scorching on a wide variety of materials.
        -	Use Tape to mask wood before engraving
        This is a sort of alternative home remedy that has proven to be useful for many people who experience burning when using their laser cutters. All you need is some everyday household masking tape that can be found at most office supply or craft stores.

        2.	Can I clean the lens and mirrors with just any cleaning solution?
        -	No, it’s important to use cleaning solutions specifically designed for laser optics. Regular cleaning solutions might leave residues that hinder laser performance.

        3.	How often should I replace the laser tube?
        -	Laser tube lifespan can vary based on usage and quality. Refer to your machine’s user manual for recommendations on tube replacement intervals.

        4.	Will a firmware update erase my machine’s settings?
        -	Firmware updates typically don’t affect saved settings. However, it’s a good practice to note down your settings before updating, just in case.

        5.	What if my Laser is not firing? 
        1) See if the Laser Tube is Disconnected
        Unplug your laser cutter, remove the tube guard, and confirm that your laser tube is plugged in.
        2) Check your Laser Tube's Life
        Check your hour counter in your touchscreen (tools > about). Your tube should last 800-1200 hours, but can be less with really intense applications. Your laser tube likely needs replaced.
        3) Power Supply Issues
        If none of the above, your power supply likely needs replaced and will need to be sent in for servicing.
