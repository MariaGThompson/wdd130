                <h3>How to prevent burning when laser cutting.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Air assist is generally just compressed air that is directed to the point at which the laser beam makes contact with the material, and can help prevent or reduce scorching on a wide variety of materials.</li>
                    <li>Use Tape to mask wood before engraving
                        This is a sort of alternative home remedy that has proven to be useful for many people who experience burning when using their laser cutters. 
                        All you need is some everyday household masking tape that can be found at most office supply or craft stores.

                <h3>Can I clean the lens and mirrors with just any cleaning solution?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No, it’s important to use cleaning solutions specifically designed for laser optics. 
                        Regular cleaning solutions might leave residues that hinder laser performance.

                <h3>How often should I replace the laser tube?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Laser tube lifespan can vary based on usage and quality. 
                        Refer to your machine’s user manual for recommendations on tube replacement intervals</li>

                <h3>Will a firmware update erase my machine’s settings?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firmware updates typically don’t affect saved settings. 
                        However, it’s a good practice to note down your settings before updating, just in case.</li>

                <h3>What if my Laser is not firing? </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>See if the Laser Tube is Disconnected:
                        Unplug your laser cutter, remove the tube guard, and confirm that your laser tube is plugged in.</li>
                    <li>Check your Laser Tube's Life:
                        Check your hour counter in your touchscreen (tools > about). Your tube should last 800-1200 hours, but can be less with really intense applications. 
                        Your laser tube likely needs replaced.
                    </li>
                    <li>Power Supply Issues:
                        If none of the above, your power supply likely needs replaced and will need to be sent in for servicing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
