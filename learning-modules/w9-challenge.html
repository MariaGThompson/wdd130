        <p class="p">Brooklyn Bridge, suspension bridge spanning the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City. 
            A brilliant feat of 19th-century engineering, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first bridge to use steel for cable wire, and during its construction explosives were used inside a pneumatic caisson for the first time. 
            Since its construction, the bridge has become an essential landmark of New York Cityâ€”an outstanding architectural accomplishment that is still revered across the world.
            Accordingly, it has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. National Park Service.
