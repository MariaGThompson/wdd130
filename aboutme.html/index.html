    <p>Hi everyone, I am originally from Russia and was adopted at 9 years old. I live in Missouri with my husband and three children.
        I love to stay active. I enjoy baking, gardening, reading, camping, and playing games with my family.
        Right now I am trying out different classes to see what degree I want. My plan is to get a BS. I did serve a mission in Washinton Tacoma Mission and loved it! 
        One of my favorite quotes is by President Thomas S. Monson, "Decisions Determine your Destiny".</p>
